# Georigna Ryder's Bunk challenge
Hey Harry & Tom, 

I completed to MVP within 5 hours however there would be some future improvements i would do if i had longer...
- With the general code there is a lot of repetition that i would of liked to refactorrefactor, this is mostly aimed at my football competent file, I would have one function for adding a player and abstract this into a service so it was re usable. Within my weather service I hard coded the URL which could be separated into ID, APPID and API key then I would have been able to re use the function. 
-   I would of liked to improved my HTTP functions for the API to include catching errors.
-	The overall styling could do with some work in terms of layout and empty spaces especially within the weather app, it would have been nice to of added icons to each place. 
-	With the football layout, I would like to make the team the main focus, and have a different colour when the player is selected.

Thanks for your time!
